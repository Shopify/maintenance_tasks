module MaintenanceTasks
  # This class encapsulates the logic behind updating the tick counter.
  #
  # It's initialized with a duration for the throttle, and a block to persist
  # the number of ticks to increment.
  #
  # When +tick+ is called, the block will be called with the increment,
  # provided the duration since the last update (or initialization) has been
  # long enough.
  #
  # To not lose any increments, +persist+ should be used, which may call the
  # block with any leftover ticks.
  #
  # @api private
  class Ticker
    # Creates a Ticker that will call the block each time +tick+ is called,
    # unless the tick is being throttled.
    #
    # @param throttle_duration [ActiveSupport::Duration, Numeric] Duration
    #   since initialization or last call that will cause a throttle.
    # @yieldparam ticks [Integer] the increment in ticks to be persisted.

    # Persists the tick increments by calling the block passed to the
    # initializer. This is idempotent in the sense that calling it twice in a
    # row will call the block at most once (if it had been throttled).
