module MaintenanceTasks
  # Class that represents the data related to a Task. Such information can be
  # sourced from a Task or from existing Run records for a Task that was since
  # deleted. This class contains higher-level information about the Task, such
  # as its status and category.
  #
  # Instances of this class replace a Task class instance in cases where we
  # don't need the actual Task subclass.
  #
  # @api private
  class TaskDataIndex
    class << self
      # Returns a list of sorted Task Data objects that represent the
      # available Tasks.
      #
      # Tasks are sorted by category, and within a category, by Task name.
      # Determining a Task's category requires their latest Run records.
      # Two queries are done to get the currently active and completed Run
      # records, and Task Data instances are initialized with these related run
      # values.
      #
      # @return [Array<TaskDataIndex>] the list of Task Data.
